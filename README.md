# Dog Sitter

## About

Some dog lovers don't have the time or money to have a full-time dog. Others want to keep their dog for an afternoon, a day, or a week without paying a huge amount of money or asking busy friends. DogSitter takes care of connecting each others. You can view the profile of a dog and its owner or search by type of dog (age, weight, distance to you). When you find the ideal dog you can contact its owner.
